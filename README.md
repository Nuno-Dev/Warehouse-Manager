# Warehouse-Manager

Welcome!

I made this project for a class called Objected Oriented Programming (OOP) using Java, during the second year of my Computer Science and Engineering degree.
This project is an Inventory Managing app for a Warehouse. The app allows the user to make transactions, dismantle products and gives price changes notifications and loyalty prizes.

All the details of the project and the instructions can be seen in the Project.pdf file.
